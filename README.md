# Customer-Satisfaction-Analysis
Customer Satisfaction Analysis involves collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data on customer experiences and perceptions through surveys, feedback forms, ratings, and reviews. By identifying key drivers of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, businesses can make informed decisions to improve products, services, and customer interactions.

It helps retain customers, boost loyalty and advocacy, drive sales growth, and gain a competitive edge, which ultimately enhances overall business performance and customer experience.

# Approach:

Identifyed which aspects (product quality, delivery time, customer service, website usability) most significantly impact overall customer satisfaction.

This project strengthened my analytical and problem-solving skills while showcasing the value of data-driven decisions to enhance customer experience and business outcomes.

# Key Outcomes

 • Customers giving low ratings span a wide age range, with notable peaks around ages 30-40
 and 50-60, which suggests age-related dissatisfaction trends.
 • Purchase amount and frequency distributions reveal that low ratings are not limited to low spenders or infrequent buyers; even high spenders and frequent buyers express dissatisfaction, which shows service quality issues.
 • Thereturn rate distribution shows that higher return rates correlate with low ratings, particularly for product quality and website ease of use, which indicates dissatisfaction with product and website experiences.
